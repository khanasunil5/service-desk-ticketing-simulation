While testing the service desk portal from a user’s point of view, a few issues stood out:
- “Get IT help” repeated in multiple areas
- Login issues scattered across categories
- No clear location for account lockouts/password resets
- Too many options leads to confusion then raising incorrect tickets

Users should be able to click once and submit the right request without thinking.
